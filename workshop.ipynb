Unlike traditional security assessments,\\nred teaming goes beyond simple vulnerability scanning or penetration\\ntesting.

This serves to safely and realistically test an\\norganisation’s capabilities to detect and respond to an attack. As the two teams\\nget to work, the blue team has to respond to the evolving techniques of the red\\nteam and they in turn adapt to the blue team and attempt to evade the controls\\nthat are in place.
